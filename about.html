            <p> This application allows you to see popular Netflix movies' trailers, descriptions, and reviews. 
                By hovering over the read more button of each film, you can see when the film was released, the director, the writer, the actors, the awards earned, the language it was made in, the ratings, and the overview.
             We take information from three different API's: one make the poster with card names, one finds the read-more information and the other provides information on where to watch the movie.</p>

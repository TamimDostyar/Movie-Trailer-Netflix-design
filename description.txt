This webapp is designed to retrieve data from three APIs

#1 Api: This makes the poster and cards with the names
#2 Api: Finds the name from 1st API and then makes the readmore information
#3 Api: Searches both apis and then provides where that movie is availble to watch

The design of the webapp derives from Netflix but not the code: the app is using Bulma for its simple designs
